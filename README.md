### Hi there 👋
🎓 About Me
Hello! I'm Max Johnson, associate conultant at Oracle. I'm deeply interested in the realms of Business and Marketing Analytics, and I'm on the lookout for opportunities to apply my skills in these fields.

🔍 My Interests

Business Analytics: I'm fascinated by how data-driven insights can transform business strategies and decision-making.

Marketing Analytics: Understanding market trends and customer behavior through analytics is something I find incredibly exciting.

Project Managemnent:Projects operate within limitations like budget, timeframes, and available resources. Project management is about optimizing these constraints to achieve the goals.
Reading Fiction: When I'm not diving into data, I love getting lost in fictional worlds, especially those crafted by my favorite author, Khaled Hosseini.
